# TI84PLUSCE_Programs
Math programs collected while taking the class with a few games sprinkled in. Each folder will hold the programs needed for that class, games folder will just have some nicely built games collected.

All the math programs were tested during taking that math class and if broken or out of date, I updated and even added new features to some, a few I even rewrote.

Example: If taking any Algebra ie Pre-Algebra, Algebra I or II, got to Math>Alegrbra and you will see all the programs needed to solve problems given with a couple of games added in. Titles are a work in progress.

# Support
This is more of a collection so depending on the app, limited support will be available.

# Supported Devices
As you can imagine this programs are for a TI calculator, hence the repo title TI 84 PLUS CE, BUT! they are not just for the TI 84 Plus CE, except the games, they are color games so meant for the CE. The math programs should all run on:

TI-83/Plus / TI-84/Silver Plus / TI-84 Plus CE

If you have an unlisted calculator and try the math programs and they work and display well please open a ticket so that calculator can be added to the supported list.

# Contributions
If you find one that you feel is good for blank class or a great game that works well, open an issue. Thanks!
